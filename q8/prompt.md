(20 points) Object Detection (Please put the classified images as part of your submission)

(a) (5 points) Classify the first 10 pictures in https://github.com/ravirajsinh45/Crop_and_weed_detection using any image classification algorithm.

(b) (5 points) Implement Yolo and do the same, what are the differences.

(c) (10 points) Using transfer learning, pick an image classification algorithm and re-train it to learn to detect a new object of interest.

(d) (10 points) Graduate Question: Implement Detectron (https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) and test the image segmentation of the objects you are interested in. Give metrics on relative segmentation/classification quality comparing: Mask R-CNN, faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet.
