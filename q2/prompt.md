(20 points) Inverse Kinematics, numerical approaches
The following SCARA-type manipulator has physical characteristics as follows: l1 =
60cm, l2 = 40cm, and an arbitrary height (ie: assume that (0,0) is at the first motor).

(a) (5 points) What is the workspace volume for this robot?. (Draw a picture of it as
well)

(b) (5 points) Write the DH parameters

(c) (10 points) Compute the forward kinematics to find the position of the end effector
if θ1 = 30deg, θ2 = 45deg, θ3 = 90deg, and d = 14cm
